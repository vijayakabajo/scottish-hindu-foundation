This project aims to establish a strong online presence for the Scottish Hindu Foundation (SHF), fostering a vibrant community and facilitating engagement with its noble causes: supporting orphanages, providing food assistance, and promoting education.

Key Features:

Masonry Gallery: Showcase captivating visuals of the SHF's activities, cultural events, and inspiring beneficiaries using a visually appealing masonry gallery layout.

Option to categorize events based on type (e.g., cultural celebration, fundraising dinner, educational workshop).

Provide clear designations for donation options (orphanage, food, education).
Offer various payment methods (e.g., credit cards, debit cards, PayPal).
Ensure a transparent and secure donation process.
Display donation goals and progress to motivate potential donors.
